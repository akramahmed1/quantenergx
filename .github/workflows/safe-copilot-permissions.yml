# --- Branch Protection & Database Safety Notes (Permanent reminders) ---

# 2. Branch Protection (Set in repo settings, not via workflow):
#    - Require PR review before merging (Copilot can review and merge if all checks pass)
#    - Disallow force pushes and branch deletions (No branch deletion in any workflow or script)
#    - Require status checks to pass before merging (Workflows ensure checks before merge)

# 3. Database Safety:
#    - Do NOT expose production database secrets in workflow secrets.
#    - Only allow minimal DB credentials for testing with isolated DB (never production).
#    - Workflow checks for destructive SQL/DB ops (DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE).
#    - Dev/Stage/Prod DBs will be separate post-launch. No destructive actions permitted on prod.
