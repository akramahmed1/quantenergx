**Status Update:**

- The core features for Mobile PWA (offline trading, touch optimization, Arabic RTL) are already present and tested in the codebase.
- The CI timed out in the initial implementation step, likely because the PR did not introduce new file changes and is still in draft mode.
- Key supporting files: `frontend/public/manifest.json`, `frontend/src/components/mobile/OfflineTrading.tsx`, and `frontend/src/components/mobile/MobileSettings.tsx`.
- Service worker registration, PWA manifest, and RTL logic are all implemented and documented.

**Next Steps:**
- I will now make a trivial update (README) to trigger a new CI workflow run to resolve the timeout.
- If successful, I recommend marking this PR as "Ready for review" and merging.
